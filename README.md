## üìë Templates

This repository also includes **standard QA templates** used across all projects.  

### **1. Test Plan**
- Defines **scope**, **objectives**, and **testing approach** for each project.  
- Outlines **test environments**, **tools**, and **resources** required.  
- Includes **entry and exit criteria**, along with a **risk assessment**.  

### **2. Test Cases**
- Contains **detailed step-by-step scenarios** for validating application features.  
- Each case includes **preconditions**, **test steps**, **expected results**, and **status tracking**.  
- Covers **positive, negative, and edge cases** to ensure full functional coverage.  

### **3. Bug Report**
- Standardized format for **logging defects** with clear **severity** and **priority** levels.  
- Captures **issue description**, **steps to reproduce**, **actual vs expected results**, and **attachments** (screenshots/logs).  
- Ensures **traceability** from defects back to test cases and requirements.  

### **4. RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix)**
- Maps **requirements to test cases** ensuring **complete coverage**.  
- Helps track which requirements are **tested, partially tested, or untested**.  
- Assists in **impact analysis** when requirements change.  

### **5. Test Reports**
- Provides a **summary of test execution** (pass/fail counts, defect density, coverage).  
- Includes **screenshots**, **logs**, and **Extent Report outputs** for better visibility.  
- Shared with stakeholders for **transparent project status updates**.  

### **6. Test Metrics**
- Tracks **KPIs** like defect density, test execution progress, and coverage percentage.  
- Provides insights for **continuous improvement** in testing processes.  
- Helps in **decision-making** for releases and next phases.
